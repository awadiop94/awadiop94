## 🔬 About Me
I’m a microbiologist and bioinformatician passionate about understanding bacterial evolution and genomic diversity. My research focuses on:

- Bacterial population structure & species borders — developing and applying new methods to delineate microbial species based on gene flow.  
- Genetic exchange particularly homologous recombination & adaptation — studying how bacterial populations exchange DNA and adapt to environmental stressors.  
- Bioinformatics pipelines & tools — developing Python scripts and computational methods for large-scale genomic analysis.  
- Statistical analysis — implementing evolutionary and population genetics models using R.  
- Mentorship & training — assisting undergraduate and graduate students in computational biology, programming, and bioinformatics tools.
